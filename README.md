# SemanticVersion
Semantic Version code challenge


# Webpage
This webpage will list versions of Software that are greater than the input.  For example, if the version entered is 2.0
than it will return all Software with a semantic version greater than 2.0.0 .
The page only cares about Major, Minor, and Patch versions.

# Approach
I used a MVC approach to build the webpage, making the classes provided the model, and then modifying the view and controller as necessary.

# What I would have done with more time.
1. More Unit Tests - I was unable to get a passing Unit Test working.  I wrote one, but it wasn't passing properly.
2. Validation - The inputs don't have validation and I would have put validation on the search box text.
3. Better UI - the UI is not really user friendly.  Had I had more time, I would have improved the user experience including better instructions and a better looking table.
4. More refactoring -  I would have cleaned up the code where I could to make it work better.
