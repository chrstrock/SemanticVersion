# SemanticVersion
Semantic Version for Emergent Software


# Webpage
This webpage will list versions of Software that are greater than the input.  For example, if the version entered is 2.0
than it will return all Software with a semantic version greater than 2.0.0 .
The page only cares about Major, Minor, and Patch versions.

# Approach
I used a MVC approach to build the webpage, making the classes provided the model, and then modifying the view and controller as necessary.
